                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Best known for developing the theory of relativity, and also made important contributions to quantum mechanics.
                My mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc², which arises from special relativity, 
                has been called "the world's most famous equation".</p>
                <p>Worked on the philosophy of science is also known for its influence.
                In 1905, I published four groundbreaking papers, sometimes described as my annus mirabilis (miracle year).
                These papers outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, 
                introduced my special theory of relativity—a theory which addressed the inability of classical mechanics to account 
                satisfactorily for the behavior of the electromagnetic field—and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, 
                mass and energy are equivalent to each other.</p>

                <p><strong>On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies.</strong> Introduced the concept that time and space are relative, leading to the famous equation 
                E=mc2. It revolutionized our understanding of space and time by showing that the laws of physics are the same for all observers, 
                regardless of their constant velocity, and that the speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference.
                    Showed that measurements of time and space depend on the observer's motion, fundamentally changing classical mechanics</p>

            <div class="paper">
                <p><strong>The Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content? </strong> This equation suggests that energy (E) and mass (m) are interchangeable; 
                    a small amount of mass can be converted into a large amount of energy. 
                    Demonstrated the equivalence of mass and energy, a fundamental principle that underpins modern physics.
                    Provided the foundation for developments in atomic energy and quantum mechanics.</p>

                <p><strong>A theory that extended special relativity to include gravity.</strong>  It replaced Newton's law of universal gravitation, 
                    proposing that gravity is not a force but the warping of spacetime by mass and energy.
                    The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity.Introduced the concept of spacetime curvature, 
                    where massive objects cause spacetime to bend, which we perceive as gravity.
                    Predicted phenomena like the bending of light by gravity and time dilation in strong gravitational fields.</p>
